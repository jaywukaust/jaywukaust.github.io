Work Remotely
=================

Inside KAUST
--------------
If you working remotely inside KAUST, you can easily work as normal if you use terminal, also you can debug your code using PyCharm but using the remote resources, or simply using TeamViewer to connect with your workstation.

Terminal
^^^^^^^^^^
If you use terminal, nothing changes. For example, you can still use ``termius`` to ssh into IBEX, and submit jobs as usual. (check `use_ibex`_.).
If you wanna debug using terminal, you can add `pdb` into your Python code.
Also, you can always use GitHub to sync your codes between multiple machines.


PyCharm Remote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to use Pycharm to debug your code, but you do not have GPUs on your local machine. You can use the remote interpreter function of PyCharm.



Outside KAUST
---------------
Note: workstations inside KAUST and IBEX can only be accessible using KAUST Network.
if you are outside KAUST, You can:

1. use KAUST VPN to login into KAUST network. (not recommended if you are out of kingdom).

2. use TeamViewer to connect your workstation or laptop in KAUST. Teamviewer can used even if your computer is locked.
