# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Face editing has recently blossomed into a highly active and significant domain, impacting numerous applications from entertainment to security. Despite its rapid growth, the field still faces challenges in establishing a universally accepted and robust evaluation mechanism that can comprehensively assess the performances of face editing techniques and their underlying generative models. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a well-defined evaluation protocol that seamlessly combines systematic experimental methodologies with thorough subjective evaluations. This collaborative approach ensures a more in-depth and unbiased examination of face editing techniques. Based on our extensive studies, we observe that traditional metrics, notably the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), serve well in measuring perceptual attributes of edited images. However, they might fall short in covering all aspects of a face editing model's capabilities. To bridge this gap, we have incorporated additional metrics that assess disentanglement and editing effectiveness, leading to the creation of a holistic assessment framework that promises a more comprehensive evaluation upon face editing capability of different deep generative models."
